AVR-PSG differences from AVR-AY:

1. Use T0 as internal clock source instead of T1
2. Now A & C have same amplitude as B (T1 PWM works in simple 8-bit mode)
3. Increased the maximum amplitude of all channels by 5 times
4. Removed support for 2ch version
5. Replaced volume tables, now AY's envelope period has 16 steps
6. Improved registers reading

AVR-PSG differences from AVR-AY:

1. Removed support for ATmega8A
2. Use T0 as internal clock source instead of T1
3. Now A & C have same amplitude as B (T1 PWM works in simple 8-bit mode)
4. Increased the maximum amplitude of all channels by 5 times
5. Removed support for 2ch version
6. Replaced volume tables, now AY's envelope period has 16 steps
7. Improved registers reading

to be continued...
